# FIFO Page-Replacement Algorithm

- This Java CLI program will serve as a case study requirement for the "Operating Systems" course. FIFO page-replacement algorithm is a simple approach for virtual memory management. It operates like a queue, replacing the page that has been in the memory for the longest time, if a requested page does not exist within the memory.  

## Created by:
- Cervantes, Elijah Gabe C. | NightServant

## Project Overview:
- The objective of this project to just implement the FIFO page-replacement algorithm with the Java programming language. The existing software program can be only displayed using the Command-Line Interpreter, indicating the program will not have Graphical User Interface. 

## Technology Stack:
- **Language**: Java
- **Tools**:
  - **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
  - **Version Control**: GitHub

## Installation and Usage:
- The project is publicly accessible. All you have to do is to download the Java File. Make sure that your computer has an IDE that is capable of running java programs (such as Visual Studio Code, Intelli J, Eclipse etc.).
